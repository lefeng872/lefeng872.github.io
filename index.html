# About Me
I'm an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Software Engineering. My research interests lie in applying verification techniques to computer systems, ensuring correctness and efficiency in complex software infrastructures. 

Previously, I conducted research on database management systems (DBMS), applying formal verification to enhance query optimization, improving execution efficiency while ensuring semantic correctness. I'm interested in applying formal methods to areas like DBMS and distributed systems and I'm actively seeking research opportunities in these fields.
